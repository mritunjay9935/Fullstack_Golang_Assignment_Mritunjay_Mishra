Apica Full stack Engineer Assignment GOALS
1. Develop a LRU cache with GET / SET / DELETE API.
2. Build a React application that consumes the LRU cache API’s.
REQUIREMENTS:
1. DevelopaLRUCache
The cache will store Key / Value with expiration. If the expiration for key is set to 5 seconds, then that key should be evicted automatically from the cache after 5 seconds.
Must Haves:
• Backend should be built on Golang.
• The GET / SET / DELETE method in cache should be exposed as API endpoints.
• Cache should be concurrent in nature.
• Use ADT data structures wherever possible.
2. DevelopaReactApplication
• That consumes Get API to get the key from cache.
• That consumes Set API to add new key/value pairs with customizable expiration times.
Good to have:
- Create a WebSocket which will reflect all the current key values pairs with their expiration time dynamically in the UI.
ADDITIONAL NOTES:
- The code should be shared as a GitHub repository, with an attached README.md file with setup instructions and any additional information. (MUST)
- Please attach resume with the assignment in the email thread.
- The focus is on code quality, functionality, and adherence to the requirements.
- Consider edge cases, error handling, and providing a clean user interface.
- Follow best practices.
